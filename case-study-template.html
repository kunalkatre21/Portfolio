                    <h2>The Problem: Chaos and Anxiety</h2>
                    <p>In 2021, India's COVID-19 vaccine rollout was chaotic. The government's Co-WIN portal was overwhelmed. Users faced a high-anxiety, low-information environment, desperately searching for slots for their families. Our challenge was to create a vastly superior, reassuring, and reliable booking experience within our consumer app.</p>

                    <h2>My Role & Process</h2>
                    <p>As the lead designer, I was responsible for the entire end-to-end user experience, from concept to launch. I worked directly with engineering to define specs, as we had no dedicated PM. My process was built around a single principle: **fight panic with clarity**.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Problem Framing:** Identifying user anxiety points: "Are there slots?", "Did my booking go through?", "What do I need to bring?".</li>
                        <li>**Logic Mapping:** Charting out the complex states: Dose 1 vs Dose 2, vaccine type (Covishield/Covaxin), paid vs free, and the specific time gap rules between doses.</li>
                        <li>**Iterative Design:** Creating high-fidelity mockups in Figma that explicitly addressed every potential question on the screen itself.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>Key Design Decisions & Challenges</h2>
                    <h3>1. The "Pre-emptive" Confirmation Screen</h3>
                    <p>The booking confirmation wasn't just a success message. It was a contract of reassurance. I meticulously designed it to include explicit instructions to prevent anxiety: "Arrive 15 minutes prior," "Bring your Passport," and clearly stating "Dose 1 of Covishield" to leave no room for doubt.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. The "Register for Alert" System & A Technical Reality Check</h3>
                    <p>We designed a notification system for when slots opened in a user's district. However, this revealed a critical design-to-engineering gap: all alerts fired at midnight when the Co-WIN system updated, crashing our servers. It was a powerful lesson in understanding the full lifecycle of a feature, beyond the UI. We had to work with engineering to build a staggered notification delivery system.</p>

                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                    <p>The feature was a massive success, helping millions of Indians secure vaccine slots during a critical time. It drove a huge surge in app downloads and established Eka.Care as a key player in the digital health space. Most importantly, it proved that thoughtful, empathetic design can make a tangible difference in people's lives, especially in moments of crisis.</p>
