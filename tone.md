# Senior Portfolio Tone Guide

## Core Philosophy: High Signal, Low Noise
Your work is substantial enough that you do not need complex vocabulary to sell it. Insecurity hides behind adjectives; confidence relies on nouns and numbers.

### 1. Kill the Adjectives (The "Resume Fluff" Rule)
Stop using generic filler words. If you have to say it, it implies you aren't demonstrating it.
*   **Stop using:** "Scalable," "Fast-paced," "Passionate," "Cutting-edge," "Innovative," "Hands-on."
*   **Instead:** Show the scale (20M users), show the speed (shipped in 24 hours), show the innovation (patent pending).
*   **Bad:** "Delivered scalable products in fast-paced environments."
*   **Good:** "Shipped Co-WIN to 20M users during the pandemic peak."

### 2. Metrics > Modifiers
Don't describe the size or impact; measure it.
*   **Bad:** "Facilitated massive scale adoption."
*   **Good:** "20 Million downloads. #1 Play Store Rank."
*   **Bad:** "Drastically improved workflow efficiency."
*   **Good:** "Reduced turnaround time from 1 week to 1 day."

### 3. Active Voice Only (The "Architected" Rule)
You are a Lead, not a bystander. Own the verb. Use simple, strong verbs.
*   **Stop using:** "Architected," "Facilitated," "Leveraged," "Utilized," "Spearheaded," "Orchestrated."
*   **Start using:** "Built," "Shipped," "Designed," "Fixed," "Led," "Code."
*   **Bad:** "I architected a paradigm shift in the design workflow."
*   **Good:** "I built a token pipeline that connected Figma to Production."

### 4. The "So What?" Test
Every sentence must answer: "Why does this matter to the business?"
*   **Bad:** "I used the Double Diamond process." (Process for process's sake)
*   **Good:** "I skipped wireframing to meet the 24-hour government deadline." (Process adapted for outcome)

## Original Thoughts
true seniority often sounds like plain English.
Junior designers use big words to make small work sound big. Senior designers use simple words because the work speaks for itself. "Architected a paradigm" sounds insecure; "Built a system that saved 20 hours a week" sounds like a Lead.
