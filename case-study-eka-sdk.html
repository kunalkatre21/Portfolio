                    <h2>The Challenge: A Scaling Crisis</h2>
                    <p>Eka.Care's consumer app was successful, but our growth was capped. Leadership's vision was to become the "OS for Health" by selling our technology to large enterprises (hospitals like Medanta) and partners (device makers like Samsung). The problem? Our app was a monolith. We couldn't just "sell" it. We needed to deconstruct our product into modular, self-contained, and brand-able "LEGO blocks" (SDKs).</p>

                    <h2>My Approach: Architecting the "Design Contract"</h2>
                    <p>As the design lead and de-facto Design System Manager, my role went far beyond Figma. I had to create a system that was both flexible for clients and robust enough to not break. I operated as a bridge between the CEO's vision and engineering reality.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Clarifying Ambiguity:</strong> I built tangible prototypes of what a "themeable SDK" could look like. This forced concrete discussions and moved the team from vague ideas to a defined project with clear goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Auditing and Deconstructing:</strong> I audited our entire app, breaking down features like "Medical Records" into logical sub-modules: `Document Upload`, `Smart OCR`, `Data Visualization`, etc. This formed the blueprint for our SDKs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Establishing the "Theming Contract":</strong> This was the most critical design decision. How do we let clients apply their brand without destroying our UX, accessibility, and engineering sanity?</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
        
                <section class="highlight-box" style="background-color: #faf8f3;">
                    <h3>Key Decision: The Semantic Theming Contract</h3>
                    <p>Instead of giving clients an entire color palette to manage (which would lead to chaos), I designed a system where they only had to provide a few semantic color tokens: `primary`, `on-primary`, `surface`, `error`, etc. Our system would then programmatically generate the full 50-shade palette, ensuring accessible contrast ratios and brand integrity. This limited, yet powerful, contract was the key to scalability.</p>

                    <h3>Cross-Functional Leadership: Designing the Workflow</h3>
                    <p>A system is useless if it's not adopted. I identified a major friction point: the development team was ignoring the system and rebuilding components because it was easier. I didn't just complain; I proposed a solution. I worked with engineering leads to champion the use of CI/CD pipelines to automatically build and distribute our theme files (`colors.xml`, etc.) directly to client projects. This made it easier to *use* the system than to ignore it, shifting my role from pure designer to process architect.</p>

                    <h2>The Impact: Unlocking a New Business</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Business Enablement:</strong> This systemic work was the foundational requirement that enabled the company to pivot to a B2B2C model, directly leading to major partnerships with clients like Medanta and Samsung.</li>
                        <li><strong>Developer Efficiency:</strong> The "native components first" philosophy and automated delivery pipeline dramatically increased developer velocity and reduced UI bugs and inconsistencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design Scalability:</strong> We could now onboard and theme a new enterprise client in a matter of hours, not weeks, which was a massive win for our business development team.</li>

                    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This project cemented my evolution from a feature designer to a platform strategist. My biggest learning was that for a system to succeed, its social and technical adoption strategy is just as important as the design of its components. You have to design the workflow, not just the pixels.</p>
